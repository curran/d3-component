# How to contribute

Any feedback, questions, bug reports, and general discussions are most welcome. Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/curran/d3-component/issues/new) to start a discussion.

To get started with development, clone the repository, run `npm install`, then run `npm test`, which passes the source code `src/component.js` through ESLint, and runs the tests found under `test`.
