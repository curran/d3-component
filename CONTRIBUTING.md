# How to contribute

Any feedback, questions, bug reports, and general discussions are most welcome.

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/curran/d3-component/issues/new) to start a discussion.

If you've created something using d3-component, we'd love to hear about it! Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/curran/d3-component/issues/new) to request adding a link in the README to your example.

To get started with development,

 * clone the repository,
 * run `npm install`, then
 * run `npm test`, which passes the source code `src/component.js` through ESLint and runs the tests found under `test`.
