These tests use [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape), and are written to match the structure of tests in [other D3 repositories](https://github.com/d3). These tests were originally scaffolded out by following instructions in [Letâ€™s Make a (D3) Plugin](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/d3-plugin/).

To run these tests, invoke the `test` script defined in `package.json` by running:

`npm test`
